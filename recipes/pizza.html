    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Bread Flour</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on <br>
            the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, <br>
            making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.
        </li>
        <li>
            You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of <br>
            flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. <br>
            However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. <br>
            Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of <br>
            olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, <br>
            encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.
        </li>
        <li>
            You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in <br>
            the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which <br>
            method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it <br>
            too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should <br>
            have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about â…“-inch <br>
            thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and<br> 
            toppings.
        </li>
    </ol>
