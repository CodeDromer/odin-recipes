    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously <br>
        cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls <br>
        for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green  <br>
        salad and crusty garlic bread.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Canned Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh Herbs</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Spices and Seasonings</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned <br>
            and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's <br>
            translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the  <br>
            parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water <br>
            until they're al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, <br> 
            the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe <br>
            (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is <br>
            assembled.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for <br>
            about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is <br>
            golden brown.
        </li>
    </ol>
